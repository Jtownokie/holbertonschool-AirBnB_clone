## **_Introduction_** 📢
The console on the AirBnb Clone project is a developer tool that can be used to manage (create, update, destroy, show etc) objects/data via CLI, and store/persist objects to a JSON file. This tool allows abstraction between storage engine and objects/data management, which in turn allows the type of storage to be easily changed.
The goal of the project is to create the data model, command interpreter, and JSON file storage. When all utilized together, it will allow to maintain the file storage engine and act on objects stored in the system with a CLI-like console.
